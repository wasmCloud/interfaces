// sqldb.smithy
// definition of an sql database capability contract
//
// The interface status is *pre-release* and subject to change.
//
// Version 0.1 of this interface has the following features:
//    Execute       - Execute sql operations (insert, update, create table, etc.)
//                    Returns number of rows affected
//    Query         - Select 0 or more rows from database
//                    The returned result set is encoded in CBOR,
//                    a language-neutral compact representation.
//    Ping          - Ping verifies a connection to the database is still alive,
//                    establishing a connection if necessary.
//
// CBOR is designed to be an extensible format that is language-neutral,
// about 50-70% denser than JSON, and suitable for constrained
// environments (low cpu and memory requirements). Parsers are simple to
// write, and libraries are availble in [several languages](https://cbor.io).
//
// Not currently supported:
// - transactions
// - batch operations (multiple execute or queries in single rpc call)
// - streaming results
// - prepared statements
// - results with NULL values, array column types, or custom column data types
//
