# wasmCloud Testing Interface
This is the interface definition for the `wasmcloud:testing` contract. This interface is not meant to be implemented as a capability provider, rather for use with the [wasmcloud-test-util](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-test/tree/main/wasmcloud-test-util)

**NOTE** - This API is currently in development and should be considered unstable and subject to change.
