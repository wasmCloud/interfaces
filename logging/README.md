# wasmCloud Builtin Logging Interface
This interface defines the wasmCloud built-in logging interface that comes with each of our supported host runtimes. Actors that use this interface must have the capability contract `wasmcloud:builtin:logging` in their claims list (`wash claims sign --logging`).

## Capability Provider Implementations

There are no external implementations for this provider as they are built directly into the host runtime.
