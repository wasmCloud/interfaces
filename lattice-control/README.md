# wasmCloud Lattice Control Interface
The lattice control interface is a smithy-defined interface contract that is expected to be consumed in one of two different ways:

* Directly - A [NATS client](https://github.com/wasmcloud/control-interface-client) library may use the data structures from this interface to communicate over the lattice control interface topic
* Indirectly - Either side of the `wasmcloud:latticecontrol` contract
    * Capability Providers - Capability providers can simply provide a wrapper around the NATS client, exposing lattice control functionality to actors
    * Actors - Actors can make use of this crate as they would any other wasmCloud interface crate

## Capability Provider Implementations
The following is a list of implementations of the `wasmcloud:latticecontrol` contract. Feel free to submit a PR adding your implementation if you have a community/open source version.
